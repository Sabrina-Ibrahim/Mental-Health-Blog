                    <p>1. Let's get moving! Keeping physically active and implimenting a daily routine is a powerful stress reducer. It will help improve
                        your mood and help you stay healthier. Try starting out slow, a 30 minute walk a day can help keep the doctor away.</p>
                    <p>2. We know, drinking can be fun but when you're dealing with anxiety try to cut alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances
                        can cause or worsen your anxiety. If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or lean on others in our support group.</p>
                    <p>3. Quit smoking and try to quit drinking caffeinated beverages. Nicotine and caffeine can worsen your anxiety.</p>
                    <p>4. Use stress management and relaxation techniques! Some of my favorites are grounding, meditating, cardio, and yoga! These things can help put
                        your mind at ease.</p>

                    <h1><center>5 Tips to help with Depression:</center></h1>
                    <p>1. Build a support network! You're doing great by starting with this group. Talking to others about what you are going through is very
                        important to keep yourself strong. If you're not comfortable with speaking with family members about certain things, therapists are a wonderful
                        tool to use to express your thoughts and work through any underlining issues you may not have realized you had.</p>
                    <p>2. Reduce your stress. Easier said than done right? When you're under stress, your body produces more of a hormone called cortisol. In the short-term, this is a good thing
                        because it helps you gear up to cope with whatever is causing the stress in your life. In the long run however, it can cause many problems for you including depression.
                        The more techniques to reduce stress you can do for yourself on a daily basis will help you reduce your risk of depression.</p>
                    <p>3. Zzzz's... Improving your sleep hygiene is a wonderful trick to help you get out of that funk. Sleep and mood are intimately related. By getting
                        a good sleep hygiene you'll be able to improve your mood and overall quality of life. Turn off your electronics at least an hour before bed. If you
                        choose to read or do work in bed, make sure you have a dim light, warm lights are best to help you fall asleep rather than staying wide awake.</p>
                    <p>4. Learning how to stop those negative thoughts. We are what we see ourselves as. Depression doesn't just make you feel bad, it can also cause you to think more negatively.
                        Changing those negative thoughts, however, can improve your mood.</p>
                    <p>5. Beat Procrastination. The symptoms of depression, such as fatigue and difficulty concentrating, make procrastination tempting.
                        Putting things off fuels depression. It can lead to increased guilt, worry, and stress. Setting deadlines and managing your time can be a helpful factor to avoid procrastination.</p>

                    <h1><center>6 Tips to help with Grief:</center></h1>
                    <p>1. Be gentle with yourself. Grief can be exhausting and heartbreaking to deal with, but caring for your body during periods of intensive stress can help you get through things.
                        Carve out time for naps, eat nourishing foods, and drink plenty of water. Alcohol and sugar may seem like quick fixes, but they can have the opposite effect.</p>
                    <p>2. Your feelings are normal! Allow yourself to feel whatever it is you feel: anger, sadness, even relief. The emotions that accompany grief are all valid.</p>
                    <p>3. You're not alone. It's hard to deal with loved ones passing, if you need support reach out to friends, family, therapists, and reach out to support groups to cope in a healthy manner.</p>
                    <p>4. Plan a distraction. Sometimes scheduling a gathering or visit with friends, family, and loved ones during these hard times so you don't feel alone or be reminded of your loved one's death.</p>
                    <p>5. Reminisce about your relationship. Focus on the good things about your relationship with your loved one and the time you had together, rather than the loss
                        Write a letter to your loved one or a note about some of your good memories. You can add to this note anytime.</p>
                    <p>6. Start a new tradition. Make a donation to a charitable organization in your loved one's name on birthdays or holidays, or plant a tree in honor of your loved one.</p>

                    <p>1. It's important to understand that the disease is causing the change in communication skills. To help ease communication reassure the person. Speak calmly and listen to his or her concerns and frustrations.
                        Try to show that you understand their emotions and fear while respecting their personal space Allowing them some peaceful quiet time can help ease their uneasiness.</p>
                    <p>2. Enable a healthy and active lifestyle for them. Consider different activties they can do such as cooking, baking, exercise, and gardening. Keeping them active and healthy can help put them in a better mood.</p>
                    <p>3. Make sure their homes are safe for them. If they have stairs make sure that there is at least one handrail. Put carpet or safety grip strips on stairs to avoid slips and falls.
                        Try to avoid busy rugs and patterns, this can confuse the person more.</p>
                    <p>4. Make sure you take care of yourself. Dementia is a tough mental illness to cope with especially with a family member. Allow yourself time to cope and take breaks as you need them. Ask for help when you need it and make sure to keep yourself full of nutrition and have plenty of exercise. Yoga is a great stress reliver as well. If you need to, it's a good idea to talk with a therapist as well.</p>
                    <p>5. Make sure you plan for the future. Start discussing early with your loved ones about important health decisions and other important questions. Get permission to speak with their doctors and lawyers so you both are on the same page.
                        Consider reviewing legal documents, financial matter, options for in-home care, long-term care, and funeral and burial arrangements.</p>
